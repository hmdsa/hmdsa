## About ## 
*(Jim)*
Taking a holistic approach to maximizing application performance and science throughput on any-scale HPC systems through: 1) monitoring of all performance impacting information with flexible frameworks for fidelity and collection periods without inducing application or system overhead, 2) developing scalable storage, retrieval, and run-time analytics to provide identification of performance impacting behaviors, 3) developing right latency feedback and mitigation strategies and mechanisms targeting applications, system software, and hardware, and users.

## HMDSA Features ##

### Unprecedented insights into system and application conditions ###
HMDSA analysis provide high resolution extraction and classification of phenomena with respect to locality, severity, and temporal extent. HMDSA high-fidelity data enables insights into phenomena occurring on timescales unresolvable by traditional monitoring capabilities.

### Act on system conditions at runtime ###
Flexible placement of analysis components and multi-directional communications enable low latency feedback of analysis results to system software, applications, and managers. Action can be taken in response to system conditions while applications are still running!

### No adverse application impact ###
HMDSA's lightweight, low overhead mechanisms enable high fidelity (e.g. sub-second) synchronized, whole system numeric and event data capture with no interference

### Platform independent with hooks for integration of site-specific resources and capabilties ###
Operate all platforms in the same way, independent of site and vendor, using HMDSA's platform independent architecture. Site-specific data sources, storage, analysis, and dashboards can be used within or beside HDMSA capabilities using HDMSA's flexible and scalable API's and transports.
