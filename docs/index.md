## About ## 
*(Jim)*
Taking a holistic approach to maximizing application performance and science throughput on any-scale HPC systems through: 1) monitoring of all performance impacting information with flexible frameworks for fidelity and collection periods without inducing application or system overhead, 2) developing scalable storage, retrieval, and run-time analytics to provide identification of performance impacting behaviors, 3) developing right latency feedback and mitigation strategies and mechanisms targeting applications, system software, and hardware, and users.

## HMDSA Features ##

HMDSA provides unique capabilities for run-time system assessment and for transforming those insights into actionable knowledge. Features of HDMSA which make is unprecendented among operational and monitoring systems are:

**Exascale-ready!**

HMDSA's architecture and analysis capabilities are exascale-ready, having been demonstrated in production on current large-scale platforms up to 1/4 size of anticipated exascale platforms. Analysis on full-system, long-term data sets have demonstrated computation times ofa few minutes for the most complex full-system analysis down to sub-second for point-in-timeanalysis on runtime data. Storage and retrieval have been demonstrated in support of analysis on several continuous years of full system data.

**Unprecedented insights into system and application conditions**

HMDSA analyses provide high resolution extraction and classification of phenomena with respect to locality, severity, and temporal extent. HMDSA high-fidelity data enables insights into phenomena occurring on timescales unresolvable by traditional monitoring capabilities.

**Respond to system conditions at runtime**

Flexible placement of analysis components and multi-directional communications enable low latency feedback of analysis results to system software, applications, and managers. Action can be taken in response to system conditions while applications are still running!

**No adverse application impact**

HMDSA's lightweight, low overhead mechanisms enable high fidelity (e.g. sub-second) synchronized, whole system numeric and event data capture with no adverse application performance impact.

**Platform independent. Integration of site-specific resources and capabilties is easy!**

Operate all platforms in the same way, independent of site and vendor, using HMDSA's platform independent architecture. Site-specific data sources, storage, analysis, and dashboards can be used within or beside HDMSA capabilities using HDMSA's flexible and scalable API's and transports.
